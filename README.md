### Don Quijote Goes Full-Stack: A Naive Exploration Of Collecting the Ultimate Toolkit

Welcome!

Here is my journey about being a full-stack helloworlder.

I've collected a bunch of my favorite tools and made my favorite toolchain for general-purpose development.

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/): functional and typed, easy to maintain and refactor. 
* [project-m36](https://github.com/agentm/project-m36): relational algebra engine, mathematically-sound expressions.
*  write your business and UI logic in one language, one file, and still clearly.
    * [concur](https://github.com/ajnsit/concur): the only paradigm that makes me understand how to write UIs consistently. 
    * [concur-replica](https://github.com/pkamenarsky/concur-replica): No JS. No REST API layer. Only Haskell. 
    * [synchron](https://github.com/pkamenarsky/synchron): a DSL that makes your synchronous logic crystal clear. 
* [Nix](https://nixos.org/): Reproducible, declarative, and reliable development (and deployment). Avoid dependency hell while managing your Haskell packages.
  * [snack](https://github.com/nmattia/snack): incremental build, no need to compile the whole program again.
